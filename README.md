PROJECT: DATA VISUALIZATION AND SANITATION
Project Name: DataVizSanitizer
Tagline: Transforming Raw Data into Interactive Insights

TEAM

Name: Anana Itohoinyene
Role: Full-stack developer and project manager
Why: Anana is the sole member of the team and is responsible for all aspects of the project, from data acquisition and cleaning to web development and deployment.

TECHNOLOGIES
To successfully complete the project, the following technologies will be employed:

Libraries: Pandas(Python library for data manipulation), Flask (Backend), D3.js (Frontend, JavaScript library for data visualization)
Languages: Python (Backend), HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
Platforms: GitHub, Heroku
Frameworks: Flask(Python web framework)
Hardware: Laptop, Internet connection

What Is Data Visualization And Sanitation:

Data Visualization: Data visualization is the process of presenting data in graphical or visual formats, such as charts, graphs, and maps, to make complex information more understandable and accessible. Visualization allows users to interpret trends, patterns, and relationships in the data quickly and intuitively, enabling better decision-making and insights. For example, you can visualize sales data using bar charts to compare revenue across different products or line charts to track sales trends over time.

Data Sanitization: Data sanitization, also known as data cleaning or data cleansing, is the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset to ensure its accuracy, completeness, and reliability for analysis and visualization. This involves tasks such as removing duplicate records, handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and validating data integrity. The goal of data sanitization is to prepare the data for analysis and visualization by removing any obstacles or biases that could affect the validity of the results. For example, you may sanitize sales data by removing duplicate entries, correcting spelling errors in product names, and filling in missing values in the revenue column.

How Does these technologies fits
 
Here’s a brief overview of how they fit together:

Python (Backend): You’ll be using Python on the backend, which is a great choice for data manipulation and analysis. It’s widely used in the data science community and has excellent libraries for working with data.
Pandas: This is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data.
Flask: This is a lightweight web framework for Python. It’s a good choice for projects where you want to have control over the components you use.
D3.js: This is a JavaScript library for creating complex and attractive data visualizations. It works in the browser and uses web standards like SVG, HTML, and CSS.
JavaScript (Frontend): JavaScript is the standard language for web development. It’s used to make the website interactive and dynamic.
HTML/CSS: These are the standard technologies for building web pages. HTML is used for the structure of the web page, while CSS is used for styling.
JSON (Database): JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy to read and write. It’s a good choice for storing data because it’s straightforward and widely supported.
